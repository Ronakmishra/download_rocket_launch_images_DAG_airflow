## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore the DAGs in this repository and set up your own Airflow environment, follow the steps below:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository


### 2️⃣ Set Up Airflow
Follow the official [Airflow installation guide](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start.html) or use the provided `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Add DAGs to Your Airflow Instance
Copy the `dags/` folder content to the `dags` directory of your Airflow installation:
```bash
cp -r dags/ /path/to/your/airflow/dags/
```

### 4️⃣ Run Airflow
Ensure your Airflow services are running:
```bash
airflow webserver & airflow scheduler
```
Access the Airflow UI at `http://localhost:8080` to explore the imported DAGs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Apache Airflow**: Orchestrating complex workflows and data pipelines.
- **Python**: DAG scripting, task creation, and workflow logic implementation.
- **PostgreSQL**: Used as the metadata database to manage Airflow workflows and store results efficiently.
